<h2>Todd A. Wood</h2>
<h3>Principal Consultant, Wood Consulting Partners, LLC</h3>

<p>
  I started writing code in the 1980s and never stopped. A BS in Computer Science taught me
  how to build things right. An MBA taught me how to build the right things. Three decades
  of hands-on experience taught me how to tell the difference.
</p>

<p>
  I've built teams, rescued failing projects, modernized legacy systems, and shipped
  solutions across industries and continents. Today, I help organizations cut through
  the hype, adopt technology that actually works, and build teams that can sustain it.
</p>

<p>
  I still write code. I still architect systems. I still believe the best technology
  leaders never lose touch with the work.
</p>

<p>
  Based in Austin, Texas. Working with clients worldwide.
