  <h2>Why We Build</h2>

  <p>Every product in our portfolio started with a problem we saw firsthand. We apply the same architectural principles, security standards, and user-focused design that we bring to client engagements.</p>

  <p><strong>Building products keeps us sharp:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We stay current with the latest frameworks and infrastructure</li>
    <li>We experience the full product lifecycle, from idea to scale</li>
    <li>We understand the challenges our consulting clients face</li>
    <li>We prove our methodologies work in production</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you hire WCP, you get a partner who has shipped real products, not just advised on them.</p>
