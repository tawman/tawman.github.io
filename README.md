I was full-stack before it had a name.

I started writing code in the 1980s and never stopped. A BS in Computer Science taught me how to build things right. An MBA taught me how to build the right things. Three decades of hands-on experience taught me how to tell the difference.

I still write code. I still architect systems. I still believe the best technology leaders never lose touch with the work.

Based in Austin, Texas. Working with clients worldwide.
