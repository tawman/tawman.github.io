<p>On .NET projects today, a common theme with setup and builds scripts is
    <a href="https://github.com/psake/psake" target="_blank">
        <em>psake</em>
    </a> and
    <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/dd793612" target="_blank">Windows PowerShell</a>. A development team member on my current project is a PowerShell Ninja, which prompted me to learn
    more about PowerShell this weekend. I watched an excellent five-part webcast series by Ed Wilson (
    <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ScriptingGuys" target="_blank">@ScriptingGuys</a>) on
    <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419" target="_blank">Scripting with Windows PowerShell</a> that got me up to speed in a couple hours.</p>
<p>These webcasts changed my viewpoint of PowerShell from being a VBScript replacement (that I never used) to a powerful scripting
    framework and shell. I have modified and extended existing
    <em>psake</em> build scripts, but I did not realize some of the key concepts lurking just below the surface.</p>
<p>I did not consider it possible that PowerShell pipelines objects between commands instead of strings due to the many years
    I spent developing shell scripts on UNIX/Linux. Once Ed explained this key concept, I discarded my preconceived understanding
    of PowerShell and watched the entire series to learn more.</p>
<p>I can only imagine how useful object pipelining in UNIX shell scripts would be after witnessing the equivalent in PowerShell.
    For example, getting basic process information from the bash prompt on the Mac can be done with the
    <em>ps</em> command. The output of the
    <em>ps</em> command can be manipulated as standard ASCII text:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2394435.js?file=BashShell.txt"></script>
<p>Conversely, the same process information in PowerShell passes along the entire process object to the next command to inspect:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2394445.js?file=PowerShell.txt"></script>
<p>Object passing between commands in PowerShell is just a minor fact hardly worth blogging about, but it is a fundamental reason
    you should ignore decades of preconceived ideas about shell scripting and give PowerShell an honest look.</p>
