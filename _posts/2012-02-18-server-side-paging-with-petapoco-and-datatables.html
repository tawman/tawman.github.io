<p>TL;DR â€“ Server-side paging of table data is not only faster and more responsive, but very easy to implement with
    <a href="http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/" target="_blank">PetaPoco</a> and
    <a href="http://datatables.net/" target="_blank">DataTables</a>. I will demonstrate how millisecond response times are still possible even when dealing with a million
    rows of data.</p>
<p>This blog post can be forked on
    <a href="https://github.com/tawman/PetaPocoPage" target="_blank">GitHub: tawman / PetaPocoPage</a>.</p>
<h2>Sample Web Site and Data</h2>
<p>For the sample web site, I used the
    <a href="http://spawner.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Spawner Data Generator</a> tool to generate 1,000,000 rows of test data for use in this example. As you can see from
    the timings, each table grid page request is limited to approximately 1.25 KB of data and a response time around 75 milliseconds.

<p>On my current project, we initially used
    <a href="http://tablesorter.com/docs/" target="_blank">jQuery tablesorter</a> with a table loading between 1,000 and 1,500 detail records for a report. There was a noticeable
    delay of a couple seconds while the data loaded. Obviously, we needed to implement server-side paging and I knew
    <a href="http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/" target="_blank">PetaPoco</a> could help on the backend. However, tablesorter had some other issues with searching paged tables that lead
    me to discover
    <a href="http://datatables.net/" target="_blank">DataTables</a>
</p>
<h2>DataTables</h2>
<p>DataTables is a great extensible jQuery plug-in and satisfied our searching, paging, and server-side processing requirements.
    The only negative issue I had is cosmetic since DataTables uses
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation" target="_blank">Hungarian notation</a>. The other features and extensibility options shine through making DataTables an excellent client
    side UI choice.</p>
<h3>Client Side Setup</h3>
<p>Wiring up a view table with DataTables is very simple, and adding the server-side callbacks and Twitter Bootstrap formatting
    is also very straight forward. In my example view, there is very little markup required and actually no model is provided:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1861582.js"></script>
<p>The sample project also includes some additional JavaScript to setup a 500 ms filtering delay before sending the search term
    back to the server, pagination styling, and CSS styling. Fortunately, the DataTables library is thoroughly documented
    on its web site along with these extension configurations.</p>
<h3>Server Side Setup</h3>
<p>DataTables will POST a JSON request back to the server Controller that I process with a custom
    <em>IModelBinder</em> to keep the Controller code clean and remove the Hungarian notation:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1861621.js"></script>
<p>The combination of the
    <em>IModelBinder</em> and a helper method to format the DataTable response keeps the Controller action code simple:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1861623.js"></script>
<p>The DataTable response formatter simply combines the
    <em>DataTablesPageRequest</em> object with the PetaPoco
    <em>Page&lt;Customer&gt;</em> object into a JSON response expected by DataTables:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1861658.js"></script>
<p>Fortunately, the DataTable request and response object formats are very compatible with how PetaPoco support paging.</p>
<h2>PetaPoco</h2>
<p>PetaPoco makes it very simple and efficient to issue paged queries to SQL Server and it handles the query rewrite to use
    <em>ROW_NUMBER</em> for you. The resulting PetaPoco
    <em>Page&lt;T&gt;</em> object makes it easy to interface with the DataTables response object:</p>
<pre><code>
public class Page&lt;T&gt; where T:new()
{
    public long CurrentPage { get; set; }
    public long ItemsPerPage { get; set; }
    public long TotalPages { get; set; }
    public long TotalItems { get; set; }
    public List&lt;T&gt; Items { get; set; }
}</code></pre>
<p>To support the DataTables searching and ordering in my sample project, I used some helper methods to apply the search criteria
    against all columns and order by the columns selected. The resulting repository method to handle the PetaPoco Page&lt;T&gt;
    query request is quite straightforward:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1861686.js"></script>
<p>In the end, it does not matter if you are dealing with 100, 1,000, or 1,000,000 rows of data. You can still achieve fast
    page response times and low latency calls to your backend database to serve data up one page at a time. The following
    timings are from pressing the Next page link 7 times:</p>
<p>
    <img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The million row sample data is not a practical use case and merely used to illustrate a point. In fact, I reduced the sample
    data down to 4,000 rows for publishing on GitHub as a 250 MB database is not very clone friendly. Have a look at the
    project source on
    <a href="https://github.com/tawman/PetaPocoPage" target="_blank">GitHub: tawman / PetaPocoPage</a> and I hope it provides a useful reference for someone faced with a similar challenge.</p>
<p>DataTables and PetaPoco were made to page together.</p>
