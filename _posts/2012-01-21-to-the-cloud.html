To state that my net presence needed an upgrade would be the under statement of the
decade. A quick glance at my legacy web site dashboard shows a perfect example of a
static web site:
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Joomla! Version:</strong>
  Joomla! 1.0.11 Stable [ Sunbow ] 28 August 2006 20:00 UTC
  <h5>Your version of Joomla! [ 1.0.11 Stable ] is 1973 days old</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>
The key to longevity of a static web site is ripping out all the framework components
that you do not need, which in the case of <em>Joomla</em> was nearly all of them. A
simple <em>htpasswd</em> file to lock down the Administration URL and you are quite
safe. I would check on the site every couple years to make sure it was still static.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to present day and I find myself work along side a number of active
bloggers. The first push came from an off hand remark by
<a title="http://jeffreypalermo.com/" href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a>
that I should use my website to blog, but the final straw came from
<a title="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/" href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/" target="_blank">Jimmy Bogard</a>
who hosted a brown bag lunch discussion on blogging yesterday.
</p>

<p>
So how should I do this? After reviewing the free and paid options over on the
WordPress.com website, I decided to host my own WordPress site on Azure. I watched
the <a title="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/windowsazure/learn/Keynote-Getting-Started-with-Windows-Azure" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/windowsazure/learn/Keynote-Getting-Started-with-Windows-Azure" target="_blank">Keynote: Getting Started with Windows Azure</a> talk by <a title="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie</a>
and wanted a reason to give Azure a try.
</p>

<p>
The are a couple great references on the net to get WordPress stood up on Azure,
so I will not go into the details here. The follow links containing instructions and
a tool for setting up your public storage container should get you going.
