	TL;DR â€“ Sample ASP.NET MVC3 application demonstrating how to load PIVOT query results as a dynamic object with
	<a href="http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/" target="_blank">PetaPoco</a> and exporting the data to Excel using
	<a href="http://doddlereport.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">DoddleReport</a>.

<h2>Dynamic Data Structures with PIVOT</h2>
<p>SQL Server 2008 R2 provides the capability to
	<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177410.aspx" target="_blank">PIVOT and UNPIVOT</a> table data depending on your need to flatten rows into columns or columns into rows. In our case,
	we needed to transform multiple rows of employee expiration dates into a single employee row with columns for each requirement
	expiration date.</p>
<h3>SQL PIVOT Query Example</h3>
<p>The following source data is used to illustrate a SQL PIVOT query in action:
	<table border="1">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Employee</th>
				<th>Requirement</th>
				<th>Expiration Date</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>John Doe</td>
				<td>Alpha</td>
				<td>01/12/2011</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>John Doe</td>
				<td>Bravo</td>
				<td>11/07/2012</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>John Doe</td>
				<td>Charlie</td>
				<td>
					<em>NULL</em>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>John Doe</td>
				<td>Delta</td>
				<td>10/11/2009</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Sally Smith</td>
				<td>Bravo</td>
				<td>05/10/2012</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Sally Smith</td>
				<td>Charlie</td>
				<td>07/04/2012</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Sally Smith</td>
				<td>Echo</td>
				<td>08/31/2012</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	The following table illustrates the results of the SQL PIVOT query:
</p>
<table border="1">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Employee</th>
			<th>Alpha</th>
			<th>Bravo</th>
			<th>Charlie</th>
			<th>Delta</th>
			<th>Echo</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>John Doe</td>
			<td>01/12/2011</td>
			<td>11/07/2012</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>10/11/2009</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Sally Smith</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>05/10/2012</td>
			<td>07/04/2012</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>08/31/2012</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Data Driven Object Structure</h3>
<p>Obviously, defining a POCO object to load the PIVOT data ahead of time is not possible if the aggregated column values are
	not known until runtime. Our initial implementation bypassed PetaPoco entirely and used a
	<em>DataTable</em> to export the data to Excel using DoddleReport. Working around PetaPoco did not seem right so I looked for
	an alternate approach involving PetaPoco.</p>
<h2>PetaPoco and Dynamic Types</h2>
<p>Fortunately, C# provides a
	<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264741.aspx" target="_blank">dynamic type</a> but I did not know if PetaPoco and DoddleReport could support this option. Every time I think we pushed
	PetaPoco to its limit, I learn that it has more tricks up its sleeve. I decided to not even consult the documentation and
	wired it up to see if we could return an
	<em>IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;</em> instead of a
	<em>DataTable</em>.</p>
<p>The answer came as no surprise when coding the PIVOT query into the Repository that PetaPoco could care less if you actually
	had a POCO:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1806105.js"></script>
<h2>DoddleReport and Dynamic Types</h2>
<p>Now that PetaPoco was returning a dynamic data set, I needed to figure out what DoddleReport could do with it. I had not
	worked with DoddleReport up to this point, but quickly located the code in our Controller that performed the export to Excel
	functionality. I checked the
	<em>ToReportSource()</em> method overloads and saw it had one for an
	<em>IEnumerable</em>.</p>
<p>Typical
	<em>ReportResult</em> Action with DoddleReport does not require much code, but it sure does a lot behind the scenes:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1806138.js"></script>
<p>My first attempt to run the export with no change to the DoddleReport code was met with a blank export. I
	<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/iToddWood/status/167737343623696387" target="_blank">tweeted</a> out my status of trying this and
	<a href="http://www.matthidinger.com/" target="_blank">Matt Hidinger</a> quickly pointed me to the
	<a href="http://doddlereport.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/840affd7397e#src%2fDoddleReport%2fDynamic%2fDynamicReportSource.cs"
	 target="_blank">DynamicReportSource.cs on CodePlex</a>. I added the
	<em>DynamicReportSource</em> code as a Helper in my project (Note: There is a
	<a href="http://nuget.org/packages/DoddleReport.Dynamic" target="_blank">Nuget package</a> for it) and tried to use it. The first issue I ran into was that the code used an
	<em>ExpandoObject</em>, but I changed it to use
	<em>dynamic</em> instead. The second issue I ran into was the handling of NULL values, but I worked around this by using a
	<em>new object()</em> when the
	<em>t.Value</em> is null.</p>
<p>Modified DoddleReport
	<em>DynamicReportSource.cs</em> file used:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1784079.js"></script>
<h2>Dynamic PetaPoco and DoddleReport</h2>
<p>With the final changes to DoddleReport in place, our project now supports exporting PIVOT reports to Microsoft Excel. I put
	together a
	<a href="https://github.com/tawman/PetaPocoPivot" target="_blank">sample ASP.NET MVC3 application</a> that demonstrates the flow of the dynamic data from SQL Server via PetaPoco and DoddleReport
	to Excel.</p>
<h3>Standard MVC ActionResult View</h3>
<p>The default Index action displays the dynamic data in a normal table view by iterating over the dynamic results:
	<img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
	 title="PivotWebExample" border="0" alt="PivotWebExample" src="/assets/images/PivotWebExample.png" width="630" height="395">
</p>
<h3>Exporting Data to Excel</h3>
<p>The
	<em>DoddleReport Excel</em> link in the header will call the /Home/PivotReport
	<em>.xlsx</em> ReportAction to trigger the export to Excel. The .xlsx extension it what tells DoddleReport we want an Excel
	result:
</p>
<p>
	<img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
	 title="PivotExcelExample" border="0" alt="PivotExcelExample" src="/assets/images/PivotExcelExample.png" width="630" height="435">
</p>
<h3>Generating a Default HTML View</h3>
<p>If you leave off the extension like the DoddleReport HTML header link does, then DoddleReport will generate the HTML view
	similar to the Index view I coded:
	<img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
	 title="PivotDoddleHtmlExample" border="0" alt="PivotDoddleHtmlExample" src="/assets/images/PivotDoddleHtmlExample.png" width="630"
	 height="395">
</p>
<p>DoddleReport supports additional formats like PDF, but I did not add the necessary Nuget packages to support it. With the
	proper library references in place, all it takes to generate a PDF is to add the .PDF extension to the ReportResult Action
	URL and DoddleReport will happily generate it for you.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yet again I learned to never underestimate PetaPoco. I now have the same respect for DoddleReport as it makes a dynamic teammate
	with PetaPoco to deliver Excel exports based on our PIVOT query results.</p>
